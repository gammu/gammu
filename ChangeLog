20070119 - 1.09.16

There was changed project leader. After few years
Marcin Wiacek (www.mwiacek.com) decided to give free hand for
Michal Cihar (www.cihar.com) for making new releases.

It was forced by many reasons - for example Marcin had less and
less time for project (everything is described in Marcin's blog
on www.gammu.org). He decided, that Gammu will be of course
still supported from his side, but currently all Marcin's patches
will be sent to Michal for applying. We hope, that this will be
very good for project and it will be extended much faster than
it was since few releases.

There will be changed some projects links soon (for example RSS
channel). See www.gammu.org for more details.

  * SMS:
    * Gammu by default uses 8 bit encoding for SMS now (and changes it only,
      when detect ANY known Default Alphabet or Unicode encoding in TPDCS).
      It will avoid decoding SMS text, when unknown/incorrect TPDCS is used.
      Please note, that all tools, which think, that Default encoding is
      default, should be changed
    * better recognizing SMS classes
    * Gammu correctly recognizes SMS with compressed texts (like specified
      in GSM 3.42). Unfortunately, decompression source is not available yet

* fixes and improvements:
  * calendar for 6020                                             (Ragnar Rova)
  * removed obsolete --savemmsfile
  * OBEX:
    * fix for getting files (Nokia phones return folder listings and files now)
    * ID_FullName in Unicode now

20051002 - 1.02.20
* new functionality:
  * --geteachmms/--getallmms/--getmmsfolders should work fine for majority
    of Nokia phones/MMS files combinations. It will be improved, but if you 
    want to have support for some feature(s) faster, please use for example 
    -save with --geteachmms, send me MMS file (which makes problems now) and 
    I will change MMS decoder.
  * started removing old & obsolete MMS code parts (some in --nokiaaddfile
    and other)

* fixes and improvements:

    only (still doesn't decode files)

  * filesystem
    * fixed AddFolder & AddFilePart & GetFileFolder for some models 
      (available in 1.02.12)
    * ID_FullName is written in GSM_File in Unicode (SNOFS and other
      projects have to be modified to handle it)
  * * Ericsson T39 UTF8 pbk                                      (Michal Cihar)
    * correct building on Fedora Core 4 x64_86
    * some Debian fixes

NOTE: Some people reported cutting last bytes during getting files over BT.
      I have fixed it by accident in 1.02.12, later tried to find reason
      and even wrote email about it. THX for Stefan Flothkoetter this situation
      is explained now :-)

NOTE2: work in progress:

NOTES: * I can't confirm in this moment some issues connected with wrong

	 (it both works OK for me)
       * BT should be checked with SE, Siemens (phones other than Nokia),
         because Gammu searches differently for RF channels and services now
       * calendar getting and setting should be checked now, because Gammu
         handles it differently now

    at least in previous test version for 6510 module
  * fixed --getmemory and caller groups info                     (Michal Cihar)

NOTES: This release is available too long after previous. Big shame, but I will
       try not to repeat this situation.

       For now I need some help from 6230i users (with WAP settings and others)

       When these issues will be resolved, I will release new stable version
       (maybe even with complete MMS getting<->decoding).

NOTE2: I had to change detecting folders for filesystem1 again. Please compare
       --getfilesystem from old and this version. If something is different,
       please let me know

20050214 - 1.00.04
* new functionality:
  * filesystem2 support is complete (setting attributes, setting dates & 
    times, using checksums, deleting files)
  * added new dku2 connection. It should handle correctly dku2 with linux
    kernel modules, but...it's for testing, if I'm right or not
  * when file is uploaded to/downloaded from phone, you have visible left time
  * new memorycard option for --nokiaaddfile

* fixes and improvements:
  * at least 6230 over infrared doesn't report all files in folders
    (over BT it's OK, I don't know how with cable). MobiMB & OPM2 have
    the same problem... Warning is displayed.
  * improved speed for --getfilesystem and --nokiaaddfile
  * fix for checking February days
  * some AMD64 fixes                                             (Michal Cihar)

20050208 - 1.00.00
* new functionality:
  * dct4: 
    * support for 3220 features                                    (Joe Neeman)
    * filesystems return info, when you try to get non existing file
  * blueat works for some SE                                     (Michal Cihar)

* fixes and improvements:
  * dct4:
    * fix for 7250/7250i features                              (Dmitry Vukolov)
    * fixed bug with adding folders (bug available in 0.99.22)
    * overwriting files not possible with filesystem 2
  * fix for checking date (bug available in 0.99.22)
  * filesystems:
    * when you try to upload file, it's saved without path         (Joe Neeman)
    * you have new options with --nokiaaddfile:
      * camera - for folder with camera pictures
      * video - for folder with video clips
      * records - for folder with sound records
      * tones, tones2 - music, tones, etc. folders
      * gallery, gallery2 - pictures, images etc.
      Earlier getting folder ID in filesystem1 (older dct4) was based for
      some models on concrete ID. It was done, because folder name was 
      different for each language version. It was wrong - Nokia for example
      in 6220 changed ID's from 5.15 to 6.29. Now it will be handled 
      differently.
      BIG REQUEST: if you have national name for folder in your 
                   phone and --nokiaaddfile doesn't find folder, please 
                   report "textall --getfilesystem" output
    * when you get file, it's saved to local folder under original name
      without path
  * * better handling Siemens                                    (Michal Cihar)
    * calling nested functions which work on static buffer can lead to crash
    * fix for restoring Unicode files
    * AT: enabling incoming SMS info now works with most phones, 
      we don't have any hardcoded parameters
    * AT: improved charset handling in AT module. It now reads 
      available and set values in phone and uses the best one instead of 
      hardcoding charset for some phones and trying all known charsets 
      for the others.
    * user function can now get ONLY location instead of complete message
      (incoming sms)

20050116 - 0.99.22
* new functionality:
  * partial support for 6230 filesystem. You can:                 (Intra Darma)
    1. see files using --getfilesystem (MMC is b:/, phone memory is a:/ 
       and app memory is c:/)
    2. get files (warning: checksums not available)
    3. upload files
  * new PHP script (other/php3) for asking server with phone about (Hugo Pinto)
    IP and uptime
  * new PHP script (other/php4) for displaying sms from smsd     (Michal Holes)
  * --getfiles displays percents, not only "*"
  * added quesses for Siemens and Bluetooth services      (Thomas Eitzenberger)
  * LAC and CID are no more swapped in AT mode                         (George)
  * * new configure option for disabling all irda and bt         (Michal Cihar)
      protocols in one
    * when you change config.h, all sources are recompiled automatically
    * Gammu displays warning, when autoconf not found
    * better info for ERR_SOURCENOTAVAILABLE
    * VCARDS:
      * recognize much more fields
      * parse name to first+last
      * parse address to all fields
      * date can be parsed without time part from vcard
      * ReadVCALDateTime returns now boolean value, if it works with success
        or not
      * using categories instead of caller groups
    * AT module:
      * better error info for enabling USSD
      * better parsing for dates & times
      * Siemens:
        * handling for CMS errors for getting pbk
        * support for CME error 100
        * use current VCARD parser to read pbk entries (instead of old Timo 
	  Teras source). It allows to parse all entries

* fixes and improvements:
  * --getfilesystem output
  * buffer overflow error for serial and win32                         (Petr V)
  * fixed bug with disabling Chat menu for 6220
  * fixed recognizing folders with Nokia filesystem
  * * fixed bug with shared compilation if Gammu was previously  (Michal Cihar)
      installed. Earlier it added -L/usr/lib before -L./common 
      and older gammu library was found
    * added -fPIC which is needed on many platform (ppc, ppc64, x86_64,...)
    * fix for displaying end time in recurrency
    * fixes for making RPM in MandrakeLinux
    * fix for leap years checking
    * AT module:
      * fix for getting pbk from Motorolas (they put names in brackets)
  * fixed syntax in Debian/rules                               (Mathias Behrle)
  * support for more unknown PBK entries for 6230 and compatible (Milan Havlik)
  * --searchmemory displays correctly userid                (Martin Samuelsson)
  * MacOS doesn't have 460800 speed                   (Xavier Jurado Cristobal)

NOTE: * it's confirmed, that 6230 RH-12 4.44, 3100 doesn't give caller id info
        in fbus/phonet frames...at least Gammu can't take it now. Any sniffs ?
      * I saw, that new Nokias don't have support for pbk in AT mode...
      * this is last test release before 1.00. I made it test release,
        because contains many parts written not by me, changes many things
        in AT module and VCARD support and support for Nokia filesystems. 
        I think few days will be enough for making tests
      * waiting in queue:
        * few patches from Michal Cihar (I will speak with him soon)
        * fix for --sendsmsdsms parameters checking (Rafal Kolida)

          It's possible, I lost something)
      * pls note, that this is first release made by lend PC. if you see
        some problems with quality, please don't blame me...

20041107 - 0.99.6
* new functionality:
  * support for recurrances includes number of retries (and end day) 
    available in 6230 (and other Series 40 2.0)
  * full support for 30 days recurrances in Nokia DCT4
  * new other/php/linked.php PHP script. It's example,       (Michele Rossetti)
    how to take SMS from Inbox in MySQL DB created by SMSD, link them, process 
    and save to new table. There are processed non-linked sms & linked sms 
    with short and long UDH
  * Inbox in MySQL DB contains new entry "Processed"         (Michele Rossetti)

* fixes and improvements:
  * N6110:                                                (Juhapekka Tolvanen)
    * --getallcalendar doesn't show "invalid location"
    * there is correctly handled situation, when text note is too long
  * N6510:
    * Chat/SyncML settings available for some models only: 5140, 6220, 6230,
      6610i, 6810, 6820, 7250, 7250i
    * finding calendar ID works correctly for 6230
  * fixed bug in activating wap/mms/chat/... settings
  * fixed bug in --restore for restoring notes with no todo
  * all recurrances for Nokia phones are handled using Alcatel style
    (it's more generic). All old backup files are automatically converted 
    during restore and "old" recurrance style is recognized. All new created 
    backup files uses new style. Because recurrance info is lost during
    restoring these files by older Gammu, version of backup files is changed
    to higher

NOTE: Recurrance support doesn't resolve all recurrance problems. 
      Example 1:
      1. set note to 20-11-2004 and recurrance to each day up to 27-11-2004
      2. delete note from 23-11-2004
      3. in phone menu you have notes in 20-11 up to 22-11 and from 24-11 up to
         27-11. For protocol you have still one note from 20-11 and 27-11
      Example 2:
      1. create note 20-11-2004
      2. set monthly repeat up to 10-10-2005
      3. Gammu will back up it (end date) as 20-09-2005 although in phone you 
         have end repeat date 10-10-2005. Note of course will have last repeat
         20-09-2005, but...

20041024 - 0.99.0
* new functionality:
  * DJGPP:
    * serial driver for DJGPP. Tested with fbus (works) and dlr3 (fails).
      This is rather hack solution. If somebody will be interested, it will be
      extended to real driver.
    * for compiling under DJGPP set some variables in cfg/makefile.cfg
      and use new "make djgpp"
  * partial solution for making prerequisites files for GCC. By default
    commented. If you want to work with it (and have correct results), please 
    uncomment lines with "-include" in cfg/makefile.glo & make buliding from
    one directory only
  * 3105 features                                                (Vincent Chau)

  * removed memory leak in FBUS2 driver
  * LAC, CID is written using big chars only
  * uncommented setting Picture Images for DCT4
  * fixed setting todo method 2 for dct4
  * SMSD - PIN is not required in config file                    (Michal Cihar)
  * 6820 doesn't have FM Radio                              (Tomasz Motylewski)
  * added RNG to list of supported ringtones                            (Zibri)

Note: if you restore sms to DCT4 using --restoresms: some Gammu versions 
      contained bug: numbers for sms folders were mixed. If you have this 
      problem, make such replacements: "Folder = 3" with "Folder = 4",
      "Folder = 1" with "Folder = 3", etc.

        even from many PC connected with PC with MySQL over network), 
        additionaly you can easy manage MySQL database from free 
        Apache + PHPMyAdmin
      * sms can be sent and received
      * all formats of sms are supported in database
      * there is own command line option in Gammu for sending sms over it
      * you can use many phones for receiving sms to the same detabase
      * you can have logs from Gammu working as sms daemon
      * phone can enter PIN after rebotting (with some models)
      * there are black and white phone number lists for incoming sms
      There are planned notifications over email (when something works wrong),
      own PHP www pages for adding outgoing sms to database and assigning 
      Delivery Reports to sent SMS

20040714 - 0.96.9
* new functionality:
  * after each using some frames connected with wap/mms/syncml/chat settings
    and bookmarks there is sent to phone frame disabling them. It will allow
    to use some soft in some situations and will allow to enter settings menu
    in some DCT4 phones after using Gammu. Please note, that Gammu is slower
    because of it, but it allows to avoid some problems
  * new --nokiamakecamerashoot
  * New two command line options, which get syncml/chat settings for DCT4 
    series 40 now. Name of syncml settings can't probably get from phone 
    (at least in 6220 5.15)

* fixes and improvements:
  * we have year 2004. It should be earlier written for example in
    configure script :-)
  * some versions of Bluez requires linking with libsdp too.      (Ivo Panacek)
    It's done now
  * changed checking for Bluez in configure
  * support for proxy blocks really complete
  * started work on making docs/help much more usefull

NOTE: * sometimes discovering phone services is not done correctly with Bluez
        and 6310i. It's during investigation. It maybe depends on phone
        firmware. If it happens for you, please report and use configure option
        --disable-bluerfsearch
      * SyncML/chat settings for Series 40, MySQL, Symbian - these are main
        topics for near future. I will process some patches from the past now
      * I plan maximally one test release before 0.97.0
      * I will add soon subpage with ability to making micropayments and
        donates online. I hope, it will help in finding some money for
        extending Gammu

20040627 - 0.96.6
* new functionality:
  * when you don't give anything in port in gammurc with bluez and bt
    connection, there are scanned all devices in range and Gammu connects
    to first with adequate service. Unfortunately, local device is checked
    too now.
  * new configure option. You can force old behaviour with Bluetooth (trying
    connecting to concrete RF channels without earlier checking, if they're
    connected with required services). In this old mode Gammu first tries to
    connect to RF channel 14 & later 15 in bluephonet. It should resolve
    compatiblity problems with old/new Series 40 phones.
  * source is prepared to have support for Affix (http://affix.sourceforge.net)
    It will be added soon
  * full support for wap/mms settings with proxy blocks (available in latest
    DCT4 series 40). This should be tested on more phones. Can have bugs
  * started work on syncml/chat settings for DCT4 series 40. New two command
    line options, which get part of settings now.

NOTE: * www moved to new server. if there are any problems with access,
        please let me know
      * I'm searching for some good service for micropayments now (which
        will allows to send money to bank account in Poland and will not
        need registering from people, who pay)
      * Gammu homepage updated - much more info about supported functions
        and possible connections
      * I decided to remove BCC X makefile now. If anyone will be interested,
        I will put it again

20040620 - 0.96.2
* new functionality:
  * when you give device address with bluetooth connections and bluez,
    Gammu checks for supported by device services and connects to correct.
    Tested with 6310i 5.52. Unfortunately, source/connection isn't very stable
    now. Work in progress

* fixes and improvements:
  * ID for 6230 now really included
  * much better linking mysql libraries           (mlistus, Liviu Daia, others)
  * max. number of WAP/MMS settings in backup files is 30     (Eduardo, others)

20040615 - 0.96.0
* new functionality:
  * ID for 6230
  * ID & initial support for 3589i                                      (bgeer)
  * 3320: getting phonebook, datetime, calendar
  * new --playsavedringtones (sets dct4 to play many tones saved in phone -
    it includes ringtones and some phones sounds)
  * --getringtoneslist get much more from dct4 than only names of ringtones
  * with MS Platform SDK (available for free                      (Intra Darma)
    http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdk-full.htm)
    and MS Visual Studio compiler available commercialy (or for free
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/) it's possible to
    get much better support for Bluetooth with MS Bluetooth stack planned
    for Windows XP SP2:
    * when you give phone address in "Port", Gammu checks all possible
      phone services and connects to some of them according to their name
      (earlier it was based on RF channel number)
    * when you don't give phone address, Gammu searches for first device
      with adequate service and connects to it. it means, that you need
      to give only connection type and nothing more. Please note, that
      searching for all devices will need more time than connecting to
      specified one
    Similiar functionality is planned for BlueZ stack (for now RF channel for 
    PHONET and Nokia is by default 15, which is good and not; in the future
    it will be detected)
  * win32 builds are created by default with bt support
  * new script for better handling phone filesystem             (Egor Kobylkin)

* fixes and improvements:
  * win32: after receiving unknown frame over irda gammu doesn't hang.
  * some fixes required for C++ compilers                     (Markus Brueffer)
  * better output with -flatall from --getfilesystem            (Egor Kobylkin)

INFO: Many planned things still stay in queue. But you know: exams (I'm still
      student) and no too much free time (some time need to be spent on more
      profitable things than Gammu). When exams will end soon, I will have
      a lot free time :-) Will start from Symbian (Thomas Lussnig files)
      and BlueTooth (BlueZ)

20040502 - 0.95.0
* new functionality:
  * enabling new menu features for 6220
  * NGAGE ID
  * smsd daemon has support for saving received SMS to MySQL database
    and SENDING SMS saved in MySQL database (this feature supports all Gammu
    formats like logos, ringtones and other). New --sendsmsdsms
  * DCT4:
    * full support for phonebook features: user ID & sms list ID (both 
      reading and saving to phone)
    * it's possible to get/set readonly WAP/MMS settings from/to phone
    * full support for NRT format
  * more speeds supported in Linux by serial driver              (Michal Cihar)
  * started work on TDMA phones (3320)

* fixes and improvements:
  * writing device in Linux didn't repeat sometimes writing      (Michal Cihar)
  * DCT4:                                                      (Dmitry Vukolov)
    * some things were commented in source, but still required
    * no problems with --backup and user ringtones
  * n6110: when you make call and have diverts, phone informs  (Mel van Rooyen)
    about it. Current module doesn't handle it as unknown

NOTES: well, good developing need some funds for research. Because of it I have
       to work on other projects too and have less time for Gammu. Happily some
       of them need somehow Gammu and this development will be continued. In
       this moment I will concentrate especially on some TDMA phones (like
       3320) and more win9x support. 

       What will be next ? I quess, that it will depend mainly on people, who 
       donate project. This is not excellent solution, but after quarrels with 
       people, who had rights/though, that have rights to some things in source
       only possible.

       Generally it's not bad, but it's not very good too. If you like Gammu 
       and want to help in development, please contact - project needs help
       a lot (testing, coding, donating, sponsoring, hosting, etc.). I quess, 
       that Michal Cihar will return soon, but even with his effort without 
       other help it will be difficult to make many required things. There are 
       lacks with SonyEricsson, Siemens and other...

TODO: update MSVC6 and borland makefiles

20040304 - 0.94.0

      are removed.

ToDo: 1.ending support for all features in new Series 40 models
      2.receiving files over OBEX
      3.more backup/restore and other functions with GUI for win32
      4.checking for available Bluetooth services and selecting adequate
        RF channels
      5.SonyEricsson issues
      6.looking into packaging - there should be again checked, if files
        for deb or tgz must be in root dir in source tarball (there are
        too many files there now)

* new functionality:
  * MSVC 2002 projects updated to MSVC 2003

  * rewritten detecting DKU5 in win32

20040120 - 0.92.9
* new functionality:
  * * Debian:                                                    (Michal Cihar)

        string is not using just lower bytes
      * corrected decoding phonebook numbers for Sagem
      * fix for phones that do not start locations from 1 such as sagem

  * much better debug info for OS and compiler

NOTE: Many exams (happily passed), a lot of work and no time for anything.

      Also many speeches with various people about sponsoring Gammu work
      (happily probably it will end with success - backup/restore for win32
      will be probably first sponsored Gammu app).

      Please test this version. It should fix probably all found problems.

20040103 - 0.92.0
* new functionality:
  * support for TPMR in SMS is complete
  * support for some Alcatel TDD formats over SMS:
    * send/savesms PICTURE -alcatelbmmi for BMMI pictures

  * * AT:                                                        (Michal Cihar)
      * decoding CME errors and enabling them on initialisation
    * added __attribute__((format(printf,...))) to functions that accepts
      printf-like params to fire warnings when it is wrong
    * new option for sending saved sms

* fixes and improvements:
  * when you will upload file to DCT4, all "/" and ":"         (Bostjan Muller)
    in filename are replaced with "_"
  * fixed bug made with 0.91 with setting SMS memories in AT module
  * fixed bug with SMS folders in DCT4 (few last releases)
  * fixed incorrect behaviour during ringtones restore                  (Walek)
    with some DCT4
  * fix for fbuspl2302 in Linux for USB cables                    (Gary Reuter)
  * better debug info for Borland C++, MSVC, Windows version
  * * fix compile time warning                                   (Michal Cihar)

      it is often undefined
    * do not print extra \n to log, when length is multiply of 16
    * fix GetNext* for Alcatel, when first location returned
      by phone isn't the lowest
    * a bit cleaned up building system
    * GetGammuVersion has smaller buffer
    * drop PreferUnicode, phone modules that have choice whether to save 
      in unicode or not (currently only AT) should decide this automatically
    * better handling of use_global (it is now not needed to be copied)
    * smfprintf and DumpMessage now requires debug level,
      as it uses it (used only global till now)
    * fixed some format strings and parameters found thanks to new warnings
    * memcpy(str1, str2, sizeof(structure)) replaced with str1 = str2,
      is is much easier to understand
    * free things that are not needed anymore
    * UnicodeLength returns 0 when string is NULL
    * SMS:
      * in EMS decoding checking if we will fit in SMSInfo (caused segfault)
      * GSM_DecodeMultiPartSMS doesn't expect anything inside structure to be
        allocated, it will allocate it dynamically
      * in GSM_ClearMultiPartSMSInfo items are sorted same way as
        in structure, just to easy checking , that nothing is missing
      * GSM_ClearMultiPartSMSInfo is called from GSM_DecodeMultiPartSMS
        to have defined initial state
      * removed useless if (SortedSMS[i] != NULL) from GetEachSMS
      * new GSM_FreeMultiPartSMSInfo to free anything allocated inside
        MultiPartSMSInfo
      * renamed GSM_EncodeMultiPartSMSInfo to GSM_MultiPartSMSInfo and
        EncodeMultiPartSMSEntry to MultiPartSMSEntry as both are for
        decoding/encoding
    * AT:
      * recognizing errors when writing memory entry
      * huge speedup of ATGEN_GetNextMemory by dynamically
        increasing number of read entries, this skips much faster
        gaps between entries
      * first call of ATGEN_GetSMSStatus doesn't fail
        when no phone sms memory
      * ATGEN_GetMemoryInfo have parameter that identifies what kind of info
        is needed, this speeds up things in many cases (like finding
        next empty location)
      * ATGEN_ReplyGetSecurityStatus - first check for PIN2/PUK2 and then for
        normal PIN/PUK, otherwise PIN2/PUK2 are never found 
      * ATGEN_PrivSetMemory:
        * REQUEST_SIZE is large enough to fit any possible text
        * detects whether saving in unicode is possible and needed and saves
          entry according to this

NOTE: many things happened in 2003 year.

      Many good (much more things and phones supported, I have started using
      colour phone, writing class version of Gammu and other. Many people
      helped very differently me in this - I will only remind Ondrej Rybin,
      Tom Nelson, Michal Cihar, Walek and many, many other. It was
      unbelievable, but happened)

      ...and...

      many wrong (each man has other meaning for "Free Software world";
      I don't know, which one is correct, which was first and "correct",
      but the truth is, that there are no ideas there. There is only
      one rule: if you give/make thousands of good things and give your
      source/work, it's OK. When you see, that this work is used everywhere
      and want also use original work for finding some money for extending it,
      immediately you will start to see many people, who will have thousands
      things to say about licenses/patents/copyrights. The magic and
      forbidden word for them is money. These people will speak, speak and
      speak. Nothing more (they won't give real help in coding or something).

      Conclusion: when you will laught from various licensing issues in
      "Closed Software World", I will say, that "Free Software world"
      is worse. This is like nest of vipers (sometimes). And shame, that
      because of it many initiatives made from hearth end or have delays.
      Be carefull.

      Second wrong thing in this year was suspending support for Nokias and
      writing some other things for some time - no access to these devices)

      What will happen in 2004 year ?

      I quess many good things only :-).

      Gammu in current form will be somehow extended. This is first good info.

      You will see Gammu written using C++. This is good, because many possible
      source problems will go away. Nobody will be able to say something about
      it. I don't have illusions, that everyone will use Gammu+ according to
      license inside, but even when some of commercional users will still want
      to use it and will pay for it, it will be very helpfull and should really
      help in accelerating progress of this software.

      I hope, that current Gammu users understand, that current GPL license
      rather prevents in making some things than help. I hope, they will
      still help somehow in my work and efforts of making good GSM software.
      I hope, that people, who helped somehow Gammu in past, won't think,
      that I started to think about earning money only.

20031223 - 0.91.0
* new functionality:
  * new connection fbuspl2302 in Linux for USB cables             (Gary Reuter)
    (clones of DKU5) based on pl2303 chip. The main difference is,
    that it needs small waiting after each write. It's probably
    issue of Linux kernel driver

* fixes and improvements:
  * startppp script handles correctly various APN
  * * Alcatel:                                                   (Michal Cihar)
      * fixed reading of item just after modifying it
        (could lead to ERR_BUG)
    * AT:
      * improved error situation detection, when sending/writing SMS
      * checking for available SMS memories before actually using them
      * do not segfault when AT+CMGW replies something unexpected
    * compilation of bluetooth
    * GSM_ReadConfig doesn't set pointers in config to local variables
    * mystrncasecmp/mywstrncasecmp now correctly handle NULL
      pointers and situation when second string is shorter
  * Bostjan Muller and 3200 RH-30 3.08: uploading apps with URL
    starting from http failed. Now http changed to wttp before sending files
    to phone

NOTE: I decided, that Gammu at least for now will be GPL.

      There is officialy started also Gammu+ with own license. First version
      of Gammu+ should be available after Christmas.

20031214 - 0.90.9
* new functionality:
  * config matrix added for 3100, 3200 (3200 both European
    and American), 6220
  * * support for picture ID in pbk in 7250/7250i               (Egor Kobylkin)
    * new --getfilefolder can get all files from
      specified file folders (and single files like --getfiles).
      It can be slower than --getfiles, because need to search all
      filesystem sometimes
  * new --networkinfo                                            (Michal Cihar)

* fixes and improvements:
  * removed few small bugs in some places
  * reformatted source in many places
  * it's possible to play ringtones again with --geteachsms
  * fix some file ID in DCT4 filesystem                         (Egor Kobylkin)
  * AT:                                                          (Michal Cihar)
    * improves error situation detection, when sending/writing SMS
    * check for available SMS memories before actually using them
    * do not segfault when AT+CMGW replies something unexpected

NOTE: many things are rewritten to meet some license doubts.

      This version is rather good tested and shouldn't rather make any
      problems, however it's always possible, that during rewriting something
      was done wrong and I didn't notified it. Please report such buggy things.

      If all license things will be explained, please expect 0.91 with LGPL
      for Christmas. It will have few other nice things too ;-)

20031207 - 0.90.7
* new functionality:
  * reading security code from all DCT4
  * --geteachsms can link EMS sequences. Currently there is majority      (...)
    of possible things recognized - linked text, fixed bitmaps,
    variable bitmaps, animations, default ringtones/animations ID, etc. etc.
    Improved API is ready now for it everything. In the future I will
    probably add some default bitmaps/ringtones.
  * added ID for various 1100,3100,3200 variants
  * added ID for 2100,3610                                             (Rakesh)
  * AT devices:
    * keys pressing
    * using AT support is more safe because incoming call info is
      handled only, when enabled
    * rewriten AT protocol module. Now should handle correctly all incoming
      frames from phones.
    * cleaned and rechecked possible answers in AT module. If something
      was done wrong, please let me know
    * it's possible to enable sending info about incoming sms to PC.
      With T310 it's possible to receive info about SMS Deliver, Reports
      are not supported. T310 sometimes goes crazy and mixes frame for
      incoming SMS and we need some tricks. Nokia returns OK for enabling
      commands, but doesn't work - I made, that all Nokia are not supported
      here now.

    DCT3 PHONES FIRMWARE AND PREPARING OPEN SOURCE REPLACEMENT FOR IT).
    CURRENTLY YOU NEED FILE WITH DEBUG TRACES (LIKE nhm5_587.txt).
    gammu --nokiadebug nhm5_587.txt v20-25,v18-19 will enable displaying
    traces for types 20-25 and 18-19 (you can give more ranges of course).
    When use types 18-19, out.xml file is additionaly created. It can be parsed
    later with OpenGPA.
    For more about these things see http://zope.achterklap.nl:8080/nokia/
  * new parameter "gammucoding" in gammurc. In Linux value (SMS WebMaster, ...)
    "utf8" will force using UTF8 console support, in win32
    can give codepage ("852", "1250", etc.) and specified
    codepage will be used. Without it default values will
    be used (default console coding). I haven't tested utf8 yet

      some hardcoded number
    * Alcatel:
      * fixed reading of alarms without date
      * call ATGEN_Terminate from ALCATEL_Terminate
      * alcabus now works okay over IrDA, the phone didn't like
        fragmented packets
    * AT models are separated to slow (M20) and fast (other). Fast work
      fast now.
    * fixed displaying of PictureID in gammu

NOTE: Changed license of project. Before saying something see copying file for
      info, why and how it's done.

      I'm searching hard for any Siemens x35 or x45 (x means any) now and
      maybe Nokia 3200 (6220 will be probably very expensive).

      Maybe somebody will be interesting in giving (for some time ?) any cheap
      DCT4 phone (maybe 6310i, maybe 3510i) to author of BlackSphere project.
      He is a student, lives in The Netherlands and could start reversing DCT4
      phones with it

      Please expect big progress in AT commands in 0.91 version

20031109 - 0.89.0.0
* new functionality:
  * encoder for VCARDS can save info about default number

      * unified message for increasing some constant to "   Increase %s\n"
      * open debug file just once, even when there are more config sections
      * much simplified content of while (Parameters[z].Function != NULL)

    * fixed compilation of gammu under some conditions:
      name colision        #define _GNU_SOURCE         #include <stdio.h>

NOTES: Adding new functionality to Nokia Series 40 phone modules will be
       probably suspended for some time. I will make fixes and fill missed
       things, but generally can't add really new things because of hardware
       issues (no available phone with more functions). I added to readme.txt
       info about all missed things and info about things, which probably never
       will be implemented (they require SDK or more info from Nokia).

       I'm thinking about changing Gammu license and probably (if there won't
       be any other possibility) I will have to give LGPL for project sponsors,
       who will request it (for other there will be GNU GPL like now).

       If You have comments, please mail me or send email to mailing list.

20030805 - 0,81,0,0
* new functionality:
  * filesystem in DCT4:
    * full support for Hidden/System file attributes
    * by default, when set files using --addfile or --nokiaaddfile GALLERY,
      file saved in phone has got date/time like date/time of last modification
      of file in PC (for now works for win32)
    * by default, when use --getfiles, created files has modification time
      like time of last modification of file in phone (for now works in win32)

  * ID for "own numbers" for 6210/DCT4                    (Andrzej Szombierski)
  * can have few config sections in gammurc. Gammu will check connection
    after connection. It's usefull for example, when you connect to your PC
    using infrared USB dongle or cable. If infrared won't be found, Gammu will
    search automatically phone in device assigned with cable. Simple.
  * ID for 7250i                                                (Limpar Andras)

          phones for now (tested on SE phones like T300 and probably there are
          no phones with more options now)
    * long ringtones can be send in downloadable profiles (--send/savesms
      PROFILE) and as normal long ringtones (--send/savesms RINGTONE xxx -long)

NOTE: during about two weeks I tried to force company, where I bought
      my graphic card, to replace it (it was defected and still with warranty)
      For now I had to buy new card :-(((((( I didn't have access to almost
      ready 0,80 version (and didn't want to make some actions with moving
      HDD to another PC, etc., etc.) and I decided to work on next branch
      on friend's PC. Now You see joined results from all this work.

      Because of this some things are dropped to 0,81 (I don't want to make
      more delays). Also all reported during last month things will be made
      there (I didn't have access to emails and will process them now)

20030628 - 0,79,0,0

    automatically
  * changes connected with RPM building:            (Ivo Panacek, Michal Cihar)
    * info in readme.txt, that rpm package can be built and how
    * there are two principle rpm versions (3.x and 4.x) in use (SuSE, RedHat)
      and they differs in (among others) binary, which is used for building;
      so new check is done in configure (= configure.in) and proper binary
      is then put into variable in Makefile.cfg
    * newly build rpms are moved from building directory (tree) to parent
      of current directory (to be found more easily)
    * added removing of autoconf cache directory into "make clean"
  * VERY EXPERIMENTAL:
    * when use vcs extension during backup, there is created VCALENDAR file
      with Calendar and ToDo. It's first step for making exchanging data
      with various PIM managers
    * started work on OBEX ("irdaobex"/"blueobex" connection      (Intra Darma)
      with "obex" model). Tested with Nokia 5100, 6310i and SonyEricsson T300:
      * can upload files to phone default inbox with --addfile (folderID = 0)
      * can get file with phone features info with --getfiles (folderID = 0)
        Doesn't work with T300 (not supported by phone ?)

    * compile time warnings in atgen about comparison between signed and
      unsigned removed
    * -autolen in send/savesms fixed
  * better allocating memory in MBUS2 driver                     (John Fremlin)
  * docs synchronized with source

NOTE: currently development will be connected with such things:
      1. OBEX & SyncML (after getting some hardware ?)
      2. full compatibility with various PIM managers
      3. Symbian support (after getting some hardware ?)
      4. DKU-5 support (after getting some hardware ?)
      5. other ;-)

    NOTE: No problems with exchanging notes among N3310, N3510, N6110,
          N6210, N6310, N5100, N5210 and compatible (there is support for
          about 7 families now). if Nokia will use longer current formats,
          automatic calendar support in the future can be problematic

    (NOTE: for now or at all it's not possible to replace default
           templates)
  * getting GPRS access points (new --getgprspoint)
  * new --savefile can extract VCARD and VCALENDAR from backup   (Bharat Varma)
    files. Later such files can be send to phone.
    Example: gammu --savefile VCARD21 backupfile d:\ala.vcf ME 1
             irftp d:\ala.vcf
    (irftp is part of Windows XP) will create VCARD file and send it to phone
  * full support for wbmp files (reading, creating, correctly adding
    to DCT4 filesystem)
  * support for GPRS and DATA bearer over SMS is now complete
    (it includes MMS settings over SMS)

    NOTE: NOKIA PHONES SEEMS TO IGNORE GPRS ONLINE SETTING. YOU HAVE TO
          SET IT MANUALLY

  * during uploading midlets Gammu displays info about uploaded midlet
  * Gammu GUI 0.0.34                                            (Luca Cassioli)
  * support for enabling/disabling LED, enabling/disabling light
    and enabling/disabling vibra supported by Imelody and EMS. Just use
    zD/zd/zL/zl/zV/zv commands in RTTL file.

* fixes and improvements:
  * many functions in service/* now gets pointer to structure    (Michal Cihar)
    instead whole structure (this should reduce memory usage)
  * by default new DCT4 use new calendar frames again
  * smaller buffer during adding files to DCT4                   (Jorge Bardok)
  * improved getting values from JAD files                       (Lim Swee Tat)

    * adding file to DCT4 can be done in parts
    * full support for JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, MIDI, JAD files ID   (Ray Molenkamp)
    * added setting colour wallpaper for DCT4                   (Ray Molenkamp)
    * during adding something to phone Gammu checks, if file/folder
      with specified name already exist. If yes, there is error returned
  * added getting and setting activated bearer for WAP settings
  * ID for N6800                                                   (Tom Nelson)
  * full support for MMS settings in DCT4

* fixes and improvements:
  * file system in DCT4 & different folder             (Lim Swee Tat and other)
    names for new models

  * improved infrared error codes
  * improved allocation memory in AT protocol module             (Michal Cihar)

20030518 - 0.75
* new functionality:
  * setting files in DCT4 (adding to Gallery, Tones, MMS folders
    and other), adding folders, deleting files

    Note1: if You saved incorrectly file and phone reboots after enabling,
           use --getfilesystem to get file ID and use --deletefile BEFORE
           entering PIN to delete this file
    Note2: support for file formats depends on phone firmware. For example
           3510 supports GIF in 16 colors and 96x65 size. Some other can
           be not shown in this phone in menu, although stay in memory
           (use --getfilesystem to find such files & --deletefiles to delete).
           New phones happily generally show incorrect files in menus and allow
           to delete them from phone menu.
    Note3: tested on 3510, 3510i and 6310i. With other will need sniffs
           (because of different bytes in header or folder names) for making
           support

  * setting colour operator logo and colour startup logo

  * irda compilation fix                                       (Roar Pettersen)
  * * write support for Alcatel (currently phonebook)            (Michal Cihar)
    * added Email2 phonebook field
    * added getting of category name to --getmemory  
  * 6210/7110 identify in some situations improved               (Bharat Varma)

NOTE: for 5100, 6100, 6610, 7210, 7250 I need testing FM & ToDo (and probably
      sniffs). Please additionaly check calendar support and report all other
      incompatibilities. Without reports I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

    experimental and THERE CAN BE SOME PROBLEMS WITH SOME SEQUENCES. PLEASE
    REPORT IT. In the future there will be added support for formating
    text, ODI, UPI and variable images (I will try to code it although I
    don't have supporting it phone)
  * added getting FM stations info. Someone should check it with N5510  (Walek)

20030126 - 0.67
* new functionality:
  * added --clearall (cleaning pbk, calendar, wap bookmarks
    and todo from phone)
  * added --addnew (adding new calendar, wap bookmarks      (Tomasz Motylewski)
    and todo from backup file without deleting existing)
  * added support for Siemens MIDI ringtones                            (Walek)

  * removed incorrect reference to man dir (it made problems during
    installing)
  * win32 dll is more stable in many situations
  * added info about used phone module to logs
  * rewritten getting SMS folder names for DCT4 (compatible with 3510
    3.37)
  * setting WAP things and getting profiles disabled for 3510 4.24 now.
    Phone restarts very often after using it. Reason unknown.
  * maximal length of SMS name is 40 chars
  * rewritten calendar structures to more portable
  * made very deep look into calendar in N62xx/71xx and DCT4 phones.
    There are two ways to access it. Gammu can support them both. However
    they make sometimes problems:

    * with method 1 can't get/set some calendar notes in 3510 3.37
    * with method 2 can't get some notes from 6210 (probably firmware here
      uses some a little different coding)

    I decided, that for setting will be used always method 2, for getting
    method 1 (for 62xx/71xx) or method 2 (for DCT4).

    Please note, that both method 1 and method 2 have problems in DCT4 with
    such notes like (tested on 6310i 5.10 and 3510 3.37):

    * Birthday with alarm. When set in phone, it always set it (time) to
      23:59.
    * Reminders with alarm. Can't get/set alarm time
    * notes other than Birthday with alarm. Can't get/set alarm type (silent
      or with tone)
    * notes with different start date/time than end date/time. Don't have
      info in frames about end date/time

    and this is not Gammu fault !

* new functionality:
  * some (started) functions for Siemens like support for VCalendar     (Walek)
    and MIDI ringtones
  * new name for 204-12 GSM operator                           (Bertrik Sikken)

        a very long time to react on first AT

      error message
    * dprintf flushes written texts
    * added Debian packaging

* fixes and improvements:

    OK in all version now ? It should...
  * SMS Daemon should be bug free now                    (me + Joergen Thomsen)
  * extensions to GSM Default Alphabet are not Nokia specific,     (Timo Teras)
    but from GSM 03.38
  * EMS functions should be bug free now                         (Ondrej Rybin)
  * removed few possibilites of memory problems from win32 dll
  * * removed possible memory problems in many places            (Michal Cihar)
    * removed some segfaults possibilities from debug system
    * configuration scripts
      * hide %c warning in newer gcc (at least for 3.0 and 3.2, but
        surely not for 2.95)
      * use "$@" instead of $* in configure, it works correctly for
        args with spaces

NOTE: Summary for 2002
      -----------------
      Current version works without bigger problems with Nokia DCT3/DCT4,
      AT (with various Siemens extensions) and Alcatel phones. User can
      exchange various formats of logos and ringtones (send them in EMS or
      Nokia format over SMS), WAP settings and bookmarks (send over SMS in
      Nokia format), etc. There is ready command line version with manual
      and SMS daemon.

        small problems can happen. Please report such situations.
        Real changes in functionality (new functions, etc.) will be
        visible soon (fast, when my flu will end).

  * fix for EMS ringtones                                    (Christian Becker)

20021112 - 0.62

NOTE: These days were very hard for me:
      1. FKN.PL (also my homepage/Gammu homepage/Gammu list) was down
         during few days. Reason: hardware faults. Sorry for it
      2. my phone was in service
      3. I had to reinstall my Linux
      4. I had to reinstall majority of my win32 environment
      5. Because of action of Netia company TopNet.PL domain sometimes work,
         sometimes not, sometimes work partialy (www works, email not). Many
         lost nerves for me and work connected with registering own domain
         mwiacek.com and changing everywhere topnet.pl addresses to mwiacek.com
      6. Family problems :-(

      Because of it there was so long timeout after 0.61 and some things are
      still not implemented. Sorry for it.

20021020 - 0.61
* new functionality:
  * getting voice records from such DCT4 like 6310 or 6310i (new
    --nokiagetvoicerecord) (EXPERIMENTAL)
    NOTE: created WAV files requires GSM 6.10 codec. In the future
          codec will be probably added to Gammu.
  * full compatiblity with EMS IMelody 1.2 (earlier          (Christian Becker)
    was 1.0), saving ime/imy files
  * docs contains examples for editing backup text files       (Kolesar Andras)
    in TextPad, backup files are now more user friendly
    for editing - for example, when delete one pbk entry,
    all after it are interpreted
  * added possibility of using standard Unix configure
    script for automatic configuring all options

CHANGED PROJECT NAME FROM MYGNOKII2 TO GAMMU
(Gammu All Mobile Management Utilities).

(Too) many people wrote to me, that MyGnokii2 name shows, that project
is connected with Gnokii and supports Nokia phones only. Currently it's
not truth - there were tested Alcatel, Nokia, Siemens and WaveCom devices
and I hope to test more :-). Also Gammu doesn't have too much shared with
Gnokii source and developing methods

PLEASE NOTE, THAT ALSO gnokiirc CONFIG FILE IS NOW NAMED gammurc !!!!!
