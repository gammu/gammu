.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Gammu requires configuration to be able to properly talk to your phone.
gammu reads configuration from a config file. It\(aqs location is determined
on runtime, see above for search paths.
.sp
You can use gammu\-config or gammu\-detect to generate
configuration file or start from \fI\%Fully documented example\fP\&.
.sp
For hints about configuring your phone, you can check Gammu Phone
Database <\fI\%https://wammu.eu/phones/\fP> to see what user users
experienced.
.sp
This file use ini file syntax, see ini\&.
.sp
Configuration file for gammu can contain several sections \- \fB[gammu]\fP, \fB[gammu1]\fP,
\fB[gammuN]\fP, ... Each section configures one connection setup and in default mode
gammu tries all of them in numerical order. You can also specify which
configuration section to use by giving it\(aqs number (\fI\%[gammu]\fP has number 0) as a
parameter to gammu and it will then use only this section.

.B Device
New in version 1.27.95.

.sp
Device node or address of phone. It depends on used connection.
.sp
For \fBcables\fP or emulated serial ports, you enter device name (for example
\fB/dev/ttyS0\fP, \fB/dev/ttyACM0\fP, \fB/dev/ircomm0\fP, \fB/dev/rfcomm0\fP on Linux,
\fB/dev/cuad0\fP on FreeBSD or \fBCOM1:\fP on Windows). The special exception are
DKU\-2 and DKU\-5 cables on Windows, where the device is automatically detected
from driver information and this parameters is ignored.

Some USB modems expose several interfaces, in such cases Gammu works best
with "User" one, you can find more information on

.sp
For \fBUSB\fP connections (currently only fbususb and dku2 on Linux), you can
specify to which USB device Gammu should connect. You can either provide
vendor/product IDs or device address on USB:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Device = 0x1234:0x5678  # Match device by vendor and product id
Device = 0x1234:\-1      # Match device by vendor id
Device = 1.10           # Match device by usb bus and device address

On Linux systems, you might lack permissions for some device nodes.
You might need to be member of some group (eg. \fBplugdev\fP or
\fBdialout\fP) or or add special udev rules to enable you access
these devices as non\-root.
.sp
For Nokia phones you can put following file (also available in sources
as \fBcontrib/udev/69\-gammu\-acl.rules\fP) as
\fB/etc/udev/rules.d/69\-gammu\-acl.rules\fP:
.INDENT 0.0

In case your USB device appears as the serial port in the system (eg.
\fB/dev/ttyACM0\fP on Linux or \fBCOM5:\fP on Windows), just use same setup as
with serial port.
.sp
For \fBBluetooth\fP connection you have to enter Bluetooth address of your phone
(you can list Bluetooth devices in range on Linux using \fBhcitool scan\fP
command). Optionally you can also force Gammu to use specified channel by
including channel number after slash.
.sp
Before using Gammu, your device should be paired with computer or you should
have set up automatic pairing.
.sp
For \fBProxy\fP connections, you need to specify command which should be
executed. It is supposed to pass bidirectional communication from Gammu to
the device. This can happen for example over network.
.sp
For \fBIrDA\fP connections, this parameters is not used at all.
.sp
If IrDA does not work on Linux, you might need to bring up the interface and
enable discovery (you need to run these commands as root):
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ip l s dev irda0 up          # Enables irda0 device
sysctl net.irda.discovery=1  # Enables device discovery on IrDA

Native IrDA is not supported on Linux, you need to setup virtual
serial port for it (eg. \fB/dev/ircomm0\fP) and use it same way as cable.
This can be usually achieved by loading modules \fBircomm\-tty\fP and \fBirtty\-sir\fP:

.B Model
Do not use this parameter unless really needed! The only use case for this is
when Gammu does not know your phone and misdetects it\(aqs features.

connection instead of letting Gammu try the best suited for selected
operation:

.B Use_Locking
On Posix systems, you might want to lock serial device when it is being used
using UUCP\-style lock files. Enabling this option (setting to yes) will make
Gammu honor these locks and create it on startup. On most distributions you
need additional privileges to use locking (eg. you need to be member of uucp
group).

.B atgen_setCNMI
For configurations using the generic AT command protocol it is possible to
override the default indicators used when a new SMS message is received.

The value for the setting is a comma delimited list of single digits
corresponding to the values for the \fBAT+CNMI\fP modem command. If a digit
is not provided, or if the provided digit is outside of the acceptable
range for the device the default value is used.
.sp
For example setting \fBatgen_setcnmi = ,,2\fP would set the third parameter of
the CNMI command to the value 2, leaving the rest of the parameters at
default, and \fBatgen_setcnmi = 1,,,1\fP would set the first and fourth parameters
respectively.
