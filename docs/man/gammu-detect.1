This program lists all devices, which might be suitable, it does not do
any probing on devices them self.
.RE
.sp
Currently it supports following devices:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
USB devices using udev
.IP \(bu 2
Serial ports using udev
.IP \(bu 2
Serial ports on Windows
.IP \(bu 2
Bluetooth devices using Bluez
.UNINDENT
.IP Note
Supported devices depend on platform you are using and compiled in
features. You can find out what is actually compiled in by running
\fI\%gammu-detect -v\fP.
.RE
.sp

.SH OUTPUT
.sp
The output of \fI\%gammu-detect\fP is configuration file for Gammu (see
\fIgammurc\fP) with configuration section for every device which might be
used with \fIgammu\fP.
.IP Note
You can choose which section to use in \fIgammu\fP by \fIgammu \-s\fP.
.RE
.sp
When invoked as \fI\%gammu-detect -d\fP, also all examined devices are
listed as comments in the output.
