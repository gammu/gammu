.SH NAME
gammu-smsdrc \- gammu-smsd(1) configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
gammu\-smsd reads configuration from a config file. It\(aqs location can be
specified on command line, otherwise default path \fB/etc/gammu\-smsdrc\fP
is used.
.sp
This file use ini file syntax, see INI file format \%<#\:ini>\&.
.sp
Configuration file of gammu\-smsd consists of at least two sections \-
\fB[gammu]\fP \%<#\:section-[gammu]> and \fB[smsd]\fP\&. For SQL Service \%<#\:gammu-smsd-sql>
you can also use \fB[sql]\fP and \fB[tables]\fP\&.
.sp
The \fB[gammu]\fP \%<#\:section-[gammu]> section is configuration of a phone connection
and is same as described in Gammu Configuration File \%<#\:gammurc> with the only exception that
\fBLogFile\fP is ignored and common logging for gammu library and
SMS daemon is used. However the \fBLogFormat\fP \%<#\:option-LogFormat> directive still
configures how much messages gammu emits.
.INDENT 0.0

Default is 60.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LoopSleep
The number of seconds how long will SMSD sleep before checking for some
activity. Please note that setting this to higher value than 1 will have
effects to other time based configurations, because they will be effectively
rounded to multiply of this value.
.sp
Setting this to 0 disables sleeping. Please note this might cause Gammu to
consume quite a lot of CPU power as it will effectively do busy loop.
.sp
This sleep is utilized only if the main loop (sending and receiving
messages) takes less than defined time. For example if you set LoopSleep to
5 seconds and sending messages take 10 seconds, no sleep will be done in
the iteration which is sending messages. Also the sleep time is lowered by
the already processed time.
.sp
Default is 1.
.UNINDENT

.sp
Default is \fBno\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B DeliveryReportDelay
Delay in seconds how long is still delivery report considered valid. This
depends on brokenness of your network (delivery report should have same
timestamp as sent message). Increase this if delivery reports are not paired
with sent messages.
.sp
Default is 600 (10 minutes).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B PhoneID
String with info about phone used for sending/receiving. This can be useful if
you want to run several SMS daemons (see Multiple modems).
.sp
When you set PhoneID, all messages (including injected ones) will be marked
by this string (stored as SenderID in the database) and it allows more SMS
daemons to share a single database.
.sp
SMSD daemon will in such case send outbox \%<#\:outbox> messages only with
matching or empty SenderID.

.sp
SMSC number to use for sending messages if not specified in the message
(see options of gammu\-smsd\-inject \%<#\:gammu-smsd-inject>).
.sp
In most cases you don\(aqt need this settings as Gammu tries to read correct
SMSC from phone, but sometimes this fails (try \fBgammu getsmsc\fP).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B RunOnReceive
Executes a program after receiving message.
.sp
This parameter is executed through shell, so you might need to escape some
special characters and you can include any number of parameters. Additionally
parameters with identifiers of received messages are appended to the command
line. The identifiers depend on used service backend, typically it is ID of
inserted row for database backends or file name for file based backends.
.sp
Gammu SMSD waits for the script to terminate. If you make some time consuming
there, it will make SMSD not receive new messages. However to limit breakage
from this situation, the waiting time is limited to two minutes. After this
time SMSD will continue in normal operation and might execute your script
again.
.sp
The process has available lot of information about received message in
environment, check RunOnReceive Directive \%<#\:gammu-smsd-run> for more details.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.SH MESSAGE FILTERING
.sp
SMSD allows one to process only limited subset of incoming messages. You can define
filters for sender number in \fB[include_numbers]\fP and
\fB[exclude_numbers]\fP sections or using
\fBIncludeNumbersFile\fP and \fBExcludeNumbersFile\fP
directives.
.sp
If \fB[include_numbers]\fP section exists, all values (keys are
ignored) from it are used as allowed phone numbers and no other message is
processed. On the other side, in \fB[exclude_numbers]\fP you can
specify numbers which you want to skip.
.sp
Lists from both sources are merged together. If there is any number in include
list, only include list is used and only messages in this list are being
accepted. If include list is empty, exclude list can be used to ignore
messages from some numbers. If both lists are empty, all messages are
accepted.
.sp
Similar filtering rules can be used for SMSC number filtering, they just use

There is more complete example available in Gammu documentation. Please note
that for simplicity following examples do not include \fB[gammu]\fP \%<#\:section-[gammu]>
section, you can look into Gammu Configuration File \%<#\:gammurc> for some examples how it can look like.
.SS Files service
.sp
SMSD configuration file for FILES backend could look like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
[smsd]
Service = files
PIN = 1234
LogFile = syslog
InboxPath = /var/spool/sms/inbox/

.SS MySQL service
.sp
If you want to use MYSQL backend, you will need something like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
[smsd]
Service = sql
Driver = native_mysql
PIN = 1234
LogFile = syslog
User = smsd

.SS Multiple modems
.sp
You can run any number of SMSD instances and they can even share same backend
database. For routing the messages, you need to set different
\fBPhoneID\fP for each instance and set \fBSenderID\fP column in
outbox \%<#\:outbox> table.
.sp
Following example shows configuration for two modems, but you can have any
number of SMSD instances. The only limitation is performance of your hardware,
especially if all modems are connected using USB.
.sp
Configuration for first SMSD:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
[gammu]
device = /dev/ttyACM0
connection = at

[smsd]
Service = sql
Driver = native_mysql
PIN = 1234
LogFile = syslog
User = smsd
Password = smsd
PC = localhost
Database = smsd
PhoneID = first
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Configuration for second SMSD:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
[gammu]
device = /dev/ttyACM1
connection = at

[smsd]
Service = sql
Driver = native_mysql
PIN = 1234
LogFile = syslog
User = smsd
Password = smsd
PC = localhost
Database = smsd
PhoneID = second
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can then start two separate instances of SMSD:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
