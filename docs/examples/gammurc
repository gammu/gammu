# Model          : use only, when Gammu doesn't recognize your phone model.
#                  Put it here. Example values: "6110", "6150", "6210", "8210"
# Connection     : type of connection. Use "fbus" or "mbus" or "dlr3" or

# SynchronizeTime: if you want to set time from computer to phone during

#                  set time again after restart)
# Logfile        : Use, when want to have logfile from communication.
# Logformat      : What debug info and format should be used:
#                  "nothing" - no debug level, "text" - transmission dump in
#                  text format, "textall" - all possible info in text format,
#                  "errors"  - errors in text format, "binary" - transmission
#                  dump in binary format
# Use_Locking    : under Unix/Linux use "yes", if want to lock used device
#                  to prevent using it by other applications
