.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Gammu requires configuration to be able to properly talk to your phone.
\fIgammu\fP reads configuration from a config file. It\(aqs location is determined
on runtime, see above for search paths.
.sp
You can use \fIgammu\-config\fP or \fIgammu\-detect\fP to generate
configuration file or start from \fI\%Fully documented example\fP.
.sp
For hints about configuring your phone, you can check Gammu Phone
Database <\fI\%http://wammu.eu/phones/\fP> to see what user users
experienced.
.sp
This file use ini file syntax, see \fIini\fP.
.sp
Configuration file for gammu can contain several sections \- \fB[gammu]\fP, \fB[gammu1]\fP,
\fB[gammuN]\fP, ... Each section configures one connection setup and in default mode
gammu tries all of them in numerical order. You can also specify which
configuration section to use by giving it\(aqs number (\fI\%[gammu]\fP has number 0) as a
parameter to \fIgammu\fP and it will then use only this section.

.sp
For Nokia cables you want to use one of following:
.INDENT 7.0

If you use some non original cable, you might need to append \fB\-nodtr\fP (eg. for
ARK3116 based cables) or \fB\-nopower\fP, but Gammu should be able to detect this
automatically.
.sp
For non\-Nokia phones connected using cable you generally want:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBat\fP
generic AT commands based connection
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can optionally specify speed of the connection, eg. \fBat19200\fP, but it is
not needed for modern USB cables.
.sp
For IrDA connections use one of following:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBirdaphonet\fP

.TP
.B \fBirdaat\fP
AT commands connection for most of phones (this is not supported on Linux).

.B Device
New in version 1.27.95.
.sp
Device node or address of phone. It depends on used connection.
.sp
For \fBcables\fP or emulated serial ports, you enter device name (for example
\fB/dev/ttyS0\fP, \fB/dev/ttyACM0\fP, \fB/dev/ircomm0\fP, \fB/dev/rfcomm0\fP on Linux,
\fB/dev/cuad0\fP on FreeBSD or \fBCOM1:\fP on Windows). The special exception are
DKU\-2 and DKU\-5 cables on Windows, where the device is automatically detected
from driver information and this parameters is ignored.
.sp
For \fBUSB\fP connections (currently only fbususb and dku2 on Linux), you can
specify to which USB device Gammu should connect. You can either provide
vendor/product IDs or device address on USB:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Device = 0x1234:0x5678  # Match device by vendor and product id
Device = 0x1234:\-1      # Match device by vendor id
Device = 1.10           # Match device by usb bus and device address
Device = 10             # Match device by usb device address
Device = serial:123456  # Match device by serial string
.ft P
.fi
.IP Note
On Linux systems, you might lack permissions for some device nodes.
You might need to be member of some group (eg. \fBplugdev\fP or
\fBdialout\fP) or or add special udev rules to enable you access
these devices as non\-root.
.sp
For Nokia phones you can put follofing file (also available in sources
as \fBcontrib/udev/45\-nokiadku2.rules\fP) as
\fB/etc/udev/rules.d/45\-nokiadku2.rules\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# udev rules file for nokia dku2 devices (udev >= 0.98)
# Put it to /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory
# Taken from http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gnokii.git/tree/Docs/sample/45\-nokiadku2.rules

.RE
.sp
In case your USB device appears as the serial port in the system (eg.
\fB/dev/ttyACM0\fP on Linux or \fBCOM5:\fP on Windows), just use same setup as
with serial port.
.sp
For \fBBluetooth\fP connection you have to enter Bluetooth address of your phone
(you can list Bluetooth devices in range on Linux using \fBhcitool scan\fP
command). Optionally you can also force Gammu to use specified channel by
including channel number after slash.
.sp
Before using Gammu, your device should be paired with computer or you should
have set up automatic pairing.
.sp
For \fBIrDA\fP connections, this parameters is not used at all.
.sp
If IrDA does not work on Linux, you might need to bring up the interface and
enable discovery (you need to run these commands as root):
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ip l s dev irda0 up          # Enables irda0 device
sysctl net.irda.discovery=1  # Enables device discovery on IrDA
.ft P
.fi
.IP Note
Native IrDA is not supported on Linux, you need to setup virtual
serial port for it (eg. \fB/dev/ircomm0\fP) and use it same way as cable.
This can be usually achieved by loading modules \fBircomm\-tty\fP and \fBirtty\-sir\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
modprobe ircomm\-tty
modprobe irtty\-sir

.B Model
Do not use this parameter unless really needed! The only use case for this is
when Gammu does not know your phone and misdetects it\(aqs features.

The only special case for using model is to force special type of OBEX
connection instead of letting Gammu try the best suited for selected
operation:

.B Use_Locking
On Posix systems, you might want to lock serial device when it is being used
using UUCP\-style lock files. Enabling this option (setting to yes) will make
Gammu honor these locks and create it on startup. On most distributions you
need additional privileges to use locking (eg. you need to be member of uucp
group).
