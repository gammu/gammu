Take text from stdin and save as text SMS into SIM/phone memory.

\fB\-folder number\fR \- save to specified folder. Numerate folders from 1.
The most often folder 1 = "Inbox", 2 = "Outbox",etc. Use \fB\-\-getsmsfolders\fR to get folder list.

\fB\-unread\fR \- makes message unread. In some phones (like 6210)
you won't see unread sms envelope after saving such
sms. In some phones with internal SMS memory (like
6210) after using it with folder 1 SIM SMS memory will be used

\fB\-read\fR \- makes message read. In some phones with internal
SMS memory (like 6210) after using it with folder 1 SIM SMS memory will be used

\fB\-len len\fR \- specify, how many chars will be read. When use this
option and text will be longer than 1 SMS, will be splitted into more
linked SMS

\fB\-autolen len\fR \- specify, how many chars will be read. When use this
option and text will be longer than 1 SMS, will be splitted into more
linked SMS.Coding type (SMS default alphabet/Unicode) is set according
to input text

\fB\-enablevoice\fR | \fB\-disablevoice\fR | \fB\-enablefax \fR |
\fB\-disablefax \fR | \fB\-enableemail \fR | \fB\-disableemail \fR \-
sms will set such indicators. Text will be cut to 1 sms.

\fB\-inputunicode\fR \- input text is in Unicode.

\fITIP:\fR
You can create Unicode file using WordPad in Win32 (during saving select
"Unicode Text Document" format). In Unix can use for example YUdit.

\fB\-replacemessages ID\fR - \fBID\fR can be 1..7. When you will use option and
send more single SMS to one recipient with the same ID, each another SMS will
replace each previous with the same ID

\fB\-replacefile file\fR  - when you want, you can make file in such format:
\fBsrc_unicode_char1,dest_unicode_char1,src_unicode_char2,dest_unicode_char2\fR
(everything in one line). After reading text for SMS from stdin there will
be made translation and each src char will be converted to dest char. In docs
there is example file (\fIreplace.txt\fR), which will change all "a" chars to "1"

\fITIP:\fR when use ~ char in sms text and \fB\-unicode\fR option
(Unicode coding required), text of sms after ~ char will blink in some phones
(like N33xx)

(like in 82xx/7110/62xx/33xx). The same Clock test will show error
when phone doesn't have internal battery for clock (like 3xxx)
...and for DCT4 (work in progress)

\fB\-\-nokianetmonitor test\fR
Takes output or set netmonitor for Nokia DCT3 phones.

\fITIP:\fR For more info about this option, please visit
\fIhttp://www.mwiacek.com\fR and read netmonitor manual.

\fITIP:\fR test \fB243\fR enables all tests (after using command
\fBgammu \-\-nokianetmonitor 243\fR in some phones like 6210 or 9210 have to
reboot them to see netmonitor menu)

\fB\-\-backup file\fR
Backup your phone to file. It's possible to backup (depends on phone):

* phonebook from SIM and phone memory
.br
* calendar notes
.br
* SMSC settings
.br
* operator logo
.br
* startup (static) logo or startup text
.br
* WAP bookmarks
.br
* WAP settings
.br
* caller logos and groups
.br
* user ringtones

when use text backup files. List can be extended on request.

\fITIP:\fR if you will backup settings to Gammu text file, it will be possible to edit
it. It's easy: many things in this file will be written double \- once in Unicode,
once in ASCII. When you will remove Unicode version Gammu will use ASCII
on \fB\-\-restore\fR (and you can easy edit ASCII text) and will convert it
according to your OS locale. When will be available Unicode version of text,
it will be used instead of ASCII (usefull with Unicode phones \- it isn't important,
what locale is set in computer and no conversion Unicode \-> ASCII and ASCII \->
Unicode is done).

\fITIP:\fR you can use any editor with regular expressions function to edit
backup text file. Example: TextPad 4.2.2 from http://www.textpad.com/
with regular expressions based on POSIX standard P1003.2 is OK for it.
Few examples for it:

.br
* to remove info about voice tags:
.br
FROM: ^Entry\\([0\-9][0\-9]\\)VoiceTag = \\(.*\\)\\n
.br
TO:
.br

* to change all numbers starting from +3620, +3630, +3660, +3670
to +3620
.br
Find: Type = NumberGeneral\\nEntry\\([0\-9][0\-9]\\)Text = "\\+36\\(20\\|30\\|60\\|70\\)
.br
Repl: Type = NumberMobile\\nEntry\\1Text = "\\+3620
.br

* to change phone numbers type to mobile for numbers starting from
+3620, +3630,... and removing the corresponding TextUnicode line
.br
F: Type = NumberGeneral\\nEntry\\([0\-9][0\-9]\\)Text = "\\+36\\([2367]0\\)\\([^\\"]*\\)"\\nEntry\\([0\-9][0\-9]\\)TextUnicode = \\([^\\n]*\\)\\n
.br
R: Type = NumberMobile\\nEntry\\1Text = "\\+36\\2\\3"\\n

\fB\-\-backupsms file\fR
.TP 
\fB\-\-restore file\fR
Restore settings written in file created using \fB\-\-backup option\fR. All things
backup'ed by \fB\-\-backup\fR can be restored (when made backup to Gammu text
file).

Please note that restoring deletes all current content in phone. If you
want only to add entries to phone, use \-\-addnew.

In some phones restoring calendar notes will not show error, but won't
be done, when phone doesn't have set clock inside.
