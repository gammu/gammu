.. _gammu-sms:

SMS and EMS commands
--------------------

Sending messages might look a bit complicated on first attempt to use.
But be patient, the command line has been written in order to allow
almost every usage. See EXAMPLE section for some hints on usage.

There is also an option to use :ref:`gammu-smsd` when you want to send or
receive more messages and process them automatically.

Introduction to SMS formats
___________________________

Gammu has support for many SMS formats like:

Nokia Smart Messaging
    used for monochromatic picture images, downloadable profiles, monochromatic operator logos, monochromatic caller logos and monophonic ringtones
Linked SMS
    both with 8 and 16-bit identification numbers in headers
EMS
    this is SMS format used for saving monochromatic images, monophonic ringtones, animations, text formatting and others
MMS notifications
    contains links where phone should download MMS
Alcatel logo messages
    proprietary format for logos


You need to ensure that the target phone supports message type you want to
send. Otherwise the phone will not be able to display it or will even crash,
because firmware of phone did not expect this possibility.

Encoding chars in SMS text
__________________________

Text in SMS can be coded using two ways:

GSM Default Alphabet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With `GSM Default Alphabet` you can fit at most 160 chars into single SMS
(Gammu doesn't support compressing such texts according to GSM standards, but
it isn't big limit, because there are no phones supporting them), but they're
from limited set:

* all Latin small and large
* all digits
* some Greek
* some other national
* some symbols like  @ ! " # & / ( ) % * + = - , . : ; < > ?
* few others

Unicode
~~~~~~~

With `Unicode` single SMS can contain at most 70 chars, but these can be
any chars including all national and special ones.

.. warning::

   Please note, that some older phones might have problems displaying such
   message.

Conversion
~~~~~~~~~~

Gammu tries to do the best to handle non ASCII characters in your message.
Everything is internally handled in Unicode (the input is converted depending
on your locales configuration) and in case message uses Unicode the text will
be given as such to the message.

Should the message be sent in GSM Default Alphabet, Gammu will try to convert
all characters to keep message readable. Gammu does support multi byte
encoding for some characters in GSM Default Alphabet (it is needed for ``^`` ``{`` ``}``
``\`` ``[`` ``]`` ``~`` ``|``). The characters which are not present in GSM Default Alphabet
are transliterated to closest ASCII equivalent (accents are removed).
Remaining not known characters are replaced by question mark.

SMS commands
____________

.. option:: addsmsfolder name

.. option:: deleteallsms folder

    Delete all SMS from specified SMS folder.

.. option:: deletesms folder start [stop]

    Delete SMS from phone. See description for :option:`gammu getsms` for info about
    sms folders naming convention.

    Locations are numerated from 1.

.. option:: displaysms ... (options like in sendsms)

    Displays PDU data of encoded SMS messages. It accepts same parameters and
    behaves same like sendsms.

.. option:: getallsms -pbk

    Get all SMS from phone. In some phones you will have also SMS templates
    and info about locations used to save Picture Images. With each sms you
    will see location. If you want to get such sms from phone alone, use
    :option:`gammu getsms`.

.. option:: geteachsms -pbk

    Similarly to :option:`gammu getallsms`. Difference is, that
    links all concatenated sms

.. option:: getsms folder start [stop]

    Get SMS.

    Locations are numerated from 1.

    Folder 0 means that sms is being read from "flat" memory (all sms from all
    folders have unique numbers). It's sometimes emulated by Gammu. You
    can use it with all phones.

    Other folders like 1, 2, etc. match folders in phone such as Inbox, Outbox, etc.
    and each sms has unique number in his folder. Name of folders can
    depend on your phone (the most often 1="Inbox", 2="Outbox", etc.).
    This method is not supported by all phones (for example, not supported
    by Nokia 3310, 5110, 6110). If work with your phone, use
    :option:`gammu getsmsfolders` to get folders list.

.. option:: getsmsc [start [stop]]

    Get SMSC settings from SIM card.

    Locations are numerated from 1.

.. option:: getsmsfolders

    Get names for SMS folders in phone

.. option:: savesms TYPE [type parameters] [type options] [-folder id] [-unread] [-read] [-unsent] [-sent] [-sender number] [-smsname name] [-smscset number] [-smscnumber number] [-reply] [-maxsms num]

   Saves SMS to phone, see below for ``TYPE`` options.

    .. option:: -smscset number

        SMSC number will be taken from phone stored SMSC configuration ``number``.

        Default: 1

    .. option:: -smscnumber number

        SMSC number

    .. option:: -reply

        reply SMSC is set

    .. option:: -folder number

        save to specified folder.

        Folders are numerated from 1.

        The most often folder 1 = "Inbox", 2 = "Outbox",etc. Use :option:`gammu getsmsfolders` to get folder list.

    .. option:: -unread

        makes message unread. In some phones (like 6210) you won't see
        unread sms envelope after saving such sms. In some phones with internal
        SMS memory (like 6210) after using it with folder 1 SIM SMS memory will be used

    .. option:: -read

        makes message read. In some phones with internal
        SMS memory (like 6210) after using it with folder 1 SIM SMS memory will be used

    .. option:: -unsent

        makes message unsent

    .. option:: -sent

        makes message sent

    .. option:: -smsname name

        set message name

        set sender number (default: ``Gammu``)

    .. option:: -maxsms num

        Limit maximum number of messages which will be
        created. If there are more messages, Gammu will terminate with failure.

    Types of messages:

    .. option:: ANIMATION frames file1 file2...

        Save an animation as a SMS. You need to give
        number of frames and picture for each frame. Each picture can be in any
        picture format which Gammu supports (B/W bmp, gif, wbmp, nol, nlm...).

    .. option:: BOOKMARK file location

        Read WAP bookmark from file created by :option:`gammu backup` command and saves in
        Nokia format as SMS


    .. option:: CALENDAR file location

        Read calendar note from file created by :option:`gammu backup` command and saves in
        VCALENDAR 1.0 format as SMS. The location identifies position of calendar item
        to be read in backup file (usually 1, but can be useful in case the backup contains
        more items).


    .. option:: CALLER file

        Save caller logo as sms in Nokia (Smart Messaging)
        format - size 72x14, two colors.

    .. option:: MMSINDICATOR URL Title Sender

        Creates a MMS indication SMS. It contains URL where the actual MMS
        payload is stored which needs to be SMIL encoded. The phone usually
        downloads the MMS data using special APN, which does not count to
        transmitted data, however there might be limitations which URLs can
        be accessed.

    .. option:: MMSSETTINGS file location

        Saves a message with MMS configuration. The
        configuration will be read from Gammu backup file from given location.

           phones - you need to put bitmap file there inside phone using
           filesystem commands.


    .. option:: PICTURE file  [-text text] [-unicode] [-alcatelbmmi]

        Read bitmap from 2 colors file (bmp, nlm, nsl, ngg, nol, wbmp, etc.), format
        into bitmap in Smart Messaging (72x28, 2 colors, called often Picture Image
        and saved with text) or Alcatel format and send/save over SMS.


    .. option:: PROFILE  [-name name] [-bitmap bitmap] [-ringtone ringtone]

        Read ringtone (RTTL) format, bitmap (Picture Image size) and name, format into
        Smart Messaging profile and send/save as SMS.

                The ``~`` char in SMS text and :option:`-unicode` option
                (Unicode coding required) can cause text of SMS after ``~``
                char  blink in some phones (like Nokia 33xx).

        .. option:: -inputunicode

            input text is in Unicode.

            .. note::

                You can create Unicode file using WordPad in Windows (during
                saving select "Unicode Text Document" format). In Unix can use
                for example YUdit or vim.

        .. option:: -text

            get text from command line instead of stdin.

        .. option:: -textutf8

            get text in UTF-8 from command line instead of stdin.

            .. note::

                Gammu detects your locales and uses by default encoding based
                on this. Use this option only when you know the input will be
                in UTF-8 in all cases.

        .. option:: -16bit

            Gammu uses SMS headers with 16-bit numbers for saving linking info

        .. option:: -replacemessages ID

            ``ID`` can be 1..7. When you will use option and send more single
            SMS to one recipient with the same ID, each another SMS will
            replace each previous with the same ID

        .. option:: -replacefile file

            File with replacement table in unicode (UCS-2), preferably with
            byte order mark (BOM). It contains pairs of chars, first one is to
            replace, second is replacement one. The replacement is done after
            reading text for the message.

            For example replacement ``1`` (0x0061) with ``a`` (0x0031) would
            be done by file with following content (hex dump, first two bytes
            is BOM)::

                ff fe 61 00 31 00

    .. option:: TODO file location

        Saves a message with a todo entry. The content will
        be read from any backup format which Gammu supports and from given location.

    .. option:: VCARD10|VCARD21 file SM|ME location [-nokia]

        Read phonebook entry from file created by :option:`gammu backup`
        command and saves in VCARD 1.0 (only name and default number) or VCARD
        2.1 (all entry details with all numbers, text and name) format as SMS.
        The location identifies position of contact item to be read in backup
        file (usually 1, but can be useful in case the backup contains more
        items).


    .. option:: WAPINDICATOR URL Title

        Saves a SMS with a WAP indication for given
        URL and title.


    .. option:: WAPSETTINGS file location DATA|GPRS

        Read WAP settings from file created by :option:`gammu backup` command

Reporting bugs
--------------

There are definitely many bugs, reporting to author is welcome. Please include
some useful information when sending bug reports (especially debug logs,

To generate debug log, enable it in :ref:`gammurc`:

.. code-block:: ini

    [gammu]
    YOUR CONNECTION SETTINGS
    logfile = /tmp/gammu.log
    logformat = textall

Alternatively you can specify logging on command line:

.. code-block:: sh

   gammu -d textall -f /tmp/gammu.log ...

With this settings, Gammu generates /tmp/gammu.log on each connection to
phone and stores dump of communication there. You can also find some
hints for improving support for your phone in this log.

See <https://wammu.eu/support/bugs/> for more information on reporting bugs.

Please report bugs to `Gammu bug tracker <https://github.com/gammu/gammu/issues>`_.
