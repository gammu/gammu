.P

Sending messages might look a bit complicated on first attempt to use.
But be patient, the command line has been written in order to allow
almost every usage. See EXAMPLE section for some hints on usage.

There is also an option to use gammu-smsd(1) when you want to send or 
receive more messages and process them automatically.

.TP
.BI "addsms" " folder file [\-yes]"

.TP
.BI "backupsms" " file [\-yes|\-all]"

Use \-yes for answering yes to all questions (backup all messages and 
delete them from phone), or \-all to just backup all folders while keeping
messages in phone.

.TP
.BI "deleteallsms" " folder"
Delete all SMS from specified SMS folder.

When give folder 1, 2, etc. sms are taken from Inbox, Outbox, etc.
and each sms has unique number in his folder. Name of folders can
depend on your phone (the most often 1="Inbox", 2="Outbox", etc.).
This method is not supported by all phones (for example, not supported

be made translation and each src char will be converted to dest char. In docs
there is example file (\fIreplace.txt\fR), which will change all "a" chars to "1"

\fITIP:\fR when use ~ char in sms text and \fB\-unicode\fR option
(Unicode coding required), text of sms after ~ char will blink in some phones
(like N33xx)

.TP
.BI "addnew" " file [\-yes]"
Adds data written in file created using \fBbackup option\fR. All things
backup'ed by \fBbackup\fR can be restored (when made backup to Gammu text
file).

Please note that this adds all content of backup file to phone and
does not care about current data in the phone (no duplicates are 
detected).

.TP
.BI "backup" " file [\-yes]"
Backup your phone to file. It's possible to backup (depends on phone and backup format):

* phonebook from SIM and phone memory
.br
* calendar notes
.br
* SMSC settings
.br
* operator logo
.br
* startup (static) logo or startup text
.br
* WAP bookmarks
.br
* WAP settings
.br
* caller logos and groups
.br
* user ringtones
.br

There are various backup formats supported and the backup format is guessed
based on file extension:

* .lmb - Nokia backup, supports contacts, caller logos and startup logo.
.br
* .vcs - vCalendar, supports calendar and todo.
.br
* .vcf - vCard, supports contacts.
.br
* .ldif - LDAP import, supports contacts.
.br
* .ics - iCalendar, supports calendar and todo.
.br
* Any other extension is Gammu backup file and it supports all data mentioned above.
.br

\fITIP:\fR if you will backup settings to Gammu text file, it will be possible to edit
it. It's easy: many things in this file will be written double - once in Unicode,
once in ASCII. When you will remove Unicode version Gammu will use ASCII
on \fBrestore\fR (and you can easy edit ASCII text) and will convert it
according to your OS locale. When will be available Unicode version of text,
it will be used instead of ASCII (usefull with Unicode phones - it isn't important,
what locale is set in computer and no conversion Unicode \-> ASCII and ASCII \->
Unicode is done).

\fITIP:\fR you can use any editor with regular expressions function to edit
backup text file. Example: TextPad 4.2.2 from http://www.textpad.com/
with regular expressions based on POSIX standard P1003.2 is OK for it.
Few examples for it:

.br
* to remove info about voice tags:
.br
FROM: ^Entry\\([0\-9][0\-9]\\)VoiceTag = \\(.*\\)\\n
.br
TO:
.br

* to change all numbers starting from +3620, +3630, +3660, +3670
to +3620
.br
Find: Type = NumberGeneral\\nEntry\\([0\-9][0\-9]\\)Text = "\\+36\\(20\\|30\\|60\\|70\\)
.br
Repl: Type = NumberMobile\\nEntry\\1Text = "\\+3620
.br

* to change phone numbers type to mobile for numbers starting from
+3620, +3630,... and removing the corresponding TextUnicode line
.br

supports for phonebook events. The file type is guessed (for input file
guess is based on extension and file content, for output solely on

Install the *.jar/*.jad file pair of a midlet in the application or game menu of the phone. You have to give the name without the jar/jad suffix, otherwise you will get the slightly confusing error message Can't open specified file. Read only ?

The option
.I \-overwrite
deletes the application's .jad and .jar files bevor installing, but doesn't delete the application data. Option
.I \-overwriteall
will also delete all data. Both these options work only for Application or Game upload.

\fIExample:\fR gammu nokiaaddfile Application Alien will read Alien.JAD and Alien.JAR and add to Applications

\fIExample:\fR gammu nokiaaddfile Tones file.mid will read file.mid and add to Tones folder

You can use jadmaker(1) to generate a .jad file from a .jar file.

.TP
.BI "backup" " file [\-yes]"
Backup your phone to file. It's possible to backup (depends on phone and backup format):

* phonebook from SIM and phone memory
.br
* calendar notes
.br
* SMSC settings
.br
* operator logo
.br
* startup (static) logo or startup text
.br
* WAP bookmarks
.br
* WAP settings
.br
* caller logos and groups
.br
* user ringtones
.br

There are various backup formats supported and the backup format is guessed
based on file extension:

* .lmb - Nokia backup, supports contacts, caller logos and startup logo.
.br
* .vcs - vCalendar, supports calendar and todo.
.br
* .vcf - vCard, supports contacts.
.br
* .ldif - LDAP import, supports contacts.
.br
* .ics - iCalendar, supports calendar and todo.
.br
* Any other extension is Gammu backup file and it supports all data mentioned above.
.br

\fITIP:\fR if you will backup settings to Gammu text file, it will be possible to edit
it. It's easy: many things in this file will be written double - once in Unicode,
once in ASCII. When you will remove Unicode version Gammu will use ASCII
on \fBrestore\fR (and you can easy edit ASCII text) and will convert it
according to your OS locale. When will be available Unicode version of text,
it will be used instead of ASCII (usefull with Unicode phones - it isn't important,
what locale is set in computer and no conversion Unicode \-> ASCII and ASCII \->
Unicode is done).

\fITIP:\fR you can use any editor with regular expressions function to edit
backup text file. Example: TextPad 4.2.2 from http://www.textpad.com/
with regular expressions based on POSIX standard P1003.2 is OK for it.
Few examples for it:

.br

The most often folder 1 = "Inbox", 2 = "Outbox", etc.

\fB\-unread\fR - makes message unread. In some phones (like 6210) you won't see 
unread sms envelope after saving such sms. In some phones with internal 
SMS memory (like 6210) after using it with folder 1 SIM SMS memory will be used

"with preview" (in phones supporting this feature like 61xx or 6210).
When use RTTL ringtones, give location and use \fB\-scale\fR, there will be written
scale info with each note. It will avoid scale problems available during

.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

There are definitely many bugs, reporting to author is welcome. Please include
some useful information when sending bug reports (especially debug logs,
operating system, it's version and phone information are needed).

.P
To generate debug log, enable it in gammurc (alternatively you can
do it on command line using \-d textall \-f /tmp/gammu.log):

    [gammu]
    ...your connection settings...
    logfile = /tmp/gammu.log
    logformat = textall

With this settings, Gammu generates /tmp/gammu.log on each connection to
phone and stores dump of communication there. You can also find some
hints for improving support for your phone in this log.

Please report bugs to <http://bugs.cihar.com>.
