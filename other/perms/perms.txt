Temat: Untarring mygnokii.tar.gz, some files w/ uncorrect permission are
created...


Hi there,

I'm here to notice everybody that making the tar xvzf of mygnokii.tar.gz
(also version 0.3.3_pre8-gold_2001_01_02) the dir "Doc/" and some
sub-directories and files under this tree, are created without read
permissions (and executing for directories)...

Should be a nice thing to correct permissions before generating the
tarball in next releases.
In the while I suggest to run this little shell that I wrote in order to
rearrange permission (enclose in attachment) in all the created tree,
starting from ./mygnokii. It must be run using the directory created by
'tar x' (generally "mygnokii") as parameter.

Best,
